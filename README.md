# Java-Programs
This repository is made solely for personal use and is a collection of all the Java programs that I have practiced over the years. These programs serve as a foundation for learning core java concepts and I have tailored most of the programs here as per my specific needs and likings but feel free to contribute and make changes to optimize these programs, if possible. Meanwhile, I will try to update this repository on a regular basis as I get time, write & learn new codes and try to include more of them as possible.
