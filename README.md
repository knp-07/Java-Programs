# Java-Programs
This repository is made solely for personal use and is a collection of all the Java programs that I have practiced over the years. These programs serve as a foundation for learning core java concepts and most of the programs here are tailored as per my specific needs and liking by me but feel free to contribute and make changes to optimize these programs, if possible. Meanwhile, I will try to update this repository on a regular basis as I get time, write & learn new programs and try to include as much as codes as possible.
